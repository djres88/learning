###i. Minimize/Unminimize
A very quick keyboard method to un-minimize a specific window or un-minimize all of an app's minimized windows is this:
* `Command ⌘+Tab ->` to the app with minimized windows, but don't release the `Command ⌘` key.
* While still holding `Command ⌘ Down ↓`, tap `Down ↓` twice, first tap enters App Exposé. A second tap takes you to the minimized windows. Then:
  - To un-minimize all windows, press Option ⌥+Return ↩  OR
  - To un-minimize a specific window navigate to the window you want with the arrow keys, then press Return ↩
