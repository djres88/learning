# Quiz for Chapter 2: Program Structure

// FIRST, THREE QUIZZES FROM THE READINGS

/*
  (1) LOOPING A TRIANGLE

  Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

  #
  ##
  ###
  ####
  #####
  ######
  #######
  It may be useful to know that you can find the length of a string by writing .length after it.

  USE THIS TO START:
  var abc = "abc";
  console.log(abc.length);
  // → 3
*/
// YOUR ANSWER TO #1:

/*
  (2) FIZZBUZZ

  Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

  When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

  (This is actually an interview question that has been claimed to weed out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved it, you’re now allowed to feel good about yourself.)
*/
// YOUR ANSWER TO #2:

/*
  (3) CHESS BOARD

  Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.

  Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
   # # # #
  # # # #
  When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a variable size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
