# Notes for Chapter 2: Program Structure

I. EXPRESSIONS & STATEMENTS
  A. Conceptual Definitions: Programming-as-a-language:
    (1) EXPRESSIONS = sentence fragments -- "phrases", if you will. Relate to noun phrases, prep phrases, etc. in English.
    (2) STATEMENTS = complete sentences. Composed of multiple phrases.
    (3) PROGRAMS = combinations of sentences -- a "story."
    TO RECAP: Programs (stories) are cohesive entities composed of many sentences (statements), which in turn are composed of many phrases (expressions).
  B. Syntax
    â€” With few exceptions, all STATEMENTS end with a ;
      --> until you know the exceptions, always use ;

II. VARIABLES
