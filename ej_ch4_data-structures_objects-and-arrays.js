I. Data Sets
  A. Chunks of data are stored as ARRAY like so:
    — var listOfNumbers = [2, 3, 5, 7]
  B. You can access elements of arrays — starting at array[0] — like so:
    — listOfNumbers[0] = 2
    — listOfNumbers[1] = 3 etc....
  C. You can also perform operations within arrays:
    — listOfNumbers[2 - 1] = 3

II. Properties
  A. Almost all JS values have properties (exceptions: null and undefined)
  B. We have certain expressions to access the properties of some value. For ex:
    — "string".length (returns length of string)
    — Math.max(x,y,z) (function that finds maximum.)
  C. How to access properties
