I. Intro
  A. The main problem of programming = keeping things simple
    — A good program controls the complexity; does what it does as simply as possible
    — Example of JavaScript syntax:
            var total = 0, count = 1;
            while (count <= 10) {
              total += count;
              count += 1;
            }
            console.log(total);
            // → 55
    — Lesson: The moral of this story is that the same program can be
      expressed in long and short, unreadable and readable ways.
  B. What Is JavaScript?
    — intro'd in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in Netscape
      Navigator browser
    — Basically, makes modern web apps possible: you can interact directly w/
      webpage without having to reload the page
      --> can also use to do clever things on non-interactive website
    — relation to Java is nil; just marketing
    — ECMAScript is synonymous with JavaScript
  C. JavaScript's Flexibility: Pros and Cons
    — JavaScript will accept nearly anything, but will not necc. interpret the
      way you want
    — makes it difficult to find problems w/ code, but gives you access to
      creative techniques
