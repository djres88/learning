To run practice files:

1) Open the packages.json file and add your desired filename as the 'main'. For example, to run exercise 13, change `main: "exercise12.js"` to `main: "exercise13.js"`
2) In the views folder, change the desired default#.ejs filename to default.ejs. For example, if you're running exercise 14, change default14.ejs to default.ejs.
3) When you're finished, change default.ejs back to its original number.
