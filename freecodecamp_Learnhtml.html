<h1> 1. INTRO: TEXT LEVELS </h2>
<p> That header was made using an HTML element -- specifically, &lt;h1&gt; (the "opening tag") and &lt;/#h1&gt; (the "closing tag"). Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with the difference being the presence of a "/" in the closing tag. In addition to h1 headers, there are other "levels" of header elements: h2, h3, up to h6 headers.

There are paragraphs, too: p elements are the preferred method for normal-sized paragraph text on websites. You can create a p element like so: </p>

<p style = "font-weight: bold">&lt;p&gt;I'm an p tag!&lt;p> </p>

<p> You can also escape the code make comments in html by bracketing text between the thingies &lt;!-- and -->. Note: You can escape the code in other ways, too; for example, when you want to insert special characters AS TEXT (e.g. &lt;) rather than have them trigger code. See <a href = "http://text-symbols.com/html/"> http://text-symbols.com/html/ </a> for more info on how to write code as text.

<h1 style = "color: GREEN"> 2. COLORS! </h1>
<p> You can change the color of a header (or paragraph):
&lt;h2&gt; style="color: red">Paint Me Red&lt;/h2&gt; would create:
<h2 style="color: red">Paint Me Red</h2>

<h1> 3. CSS </h1>
<p>When you entered &lt;h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp&lt;/h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style. Often the better way is by using CSS ("Cascading Style Sheets"). Besides color, there are hundreds of CSS properties you can use to change the way an element looks on your page. </p>

<p> To use CSS, first create a style element: &lt;style>&lt;/style>. </p>

<p> Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: </p>

<code> &lt;style> </code> <br>
<code> &emsp; h2 { </code> <br>
<code> &emsp;&emsp; color: red; </code> <br>
<code> &emsp; } </code> <br>
<code> &lt;/style>. <code/> <br>

<p> Note the opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style. Also be sure to add the semicolon to the end of each of your element's styles. </p>

<h1> 4. STYLE CLASSES </h1> <!--
Classes are reusable styles that can be added to HTML elements. Here's an example CSS class declaration:

<style>
  .blue-text {
    color: blue;
   }
</style>

We've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag. Note the presence of a "." preceding the class name.

Once you declare a class, you can apply it to an html element. For example, here we apply .blue-text to the h2 element:
<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>.

WHY IS THIS USEFUL? Instead of applying a single style to every h2 element – or dictating the styles for each individual header – you can "save" a class (a style setting) and call it as needed. Think of these classes as style templates.

<h1> Font-Size and Font-Type </h1> <!--

You can also change the FONT SIZE using font-size and px: h1 { font-size: 30px; }. You can change the FONT TYPE by using the font-family property. For example, if you wanted to set a style class "classy" with font size 16px and font type Sans-serif:

<style>
  .classy {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
</style>

Now we could apply the class to an h2 header:
<h2 class="classy">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Becomes: -->
<style>
.classy {
  font-size: 16px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
</style>
<h2 class="classy">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<h1> Import a Font </h1> <!--
Make a call to Google to grab the Lobster font and load it into your HTML. To do this, copy the following code snippet and paste it into your code editor (at the top): <link href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lobster" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">. Now you can set Lobster as a font-family value on your h2 element:

  h2 {
  font-family: Lobster;
}

You can specify how fonts should "degrade" if a font isn't available. Think of these as the "backup plan" fonts. For example, if you wanted an element to use the Helvetica font, but also degrade to the Sans-Serif font when Helvetica wasn't available, you could use this CSS style: p { font-family: Helvetica, Sans-Serif; }.

<h1> Images </h1>
<h2> Adding Images </h2>
<!--
You can add images to your website by using the img element, and point to a specific image's URL using the src attribute. An example of this would be <img src="http://www.your-image-source.com/your-image.jpg">. Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing. -->
<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat">

<h2> Resizing Images </h2> <!--
Control width using "width: 100px;". For example, if we wanted to create a CSS class called larger-image that gave HTML elements a width of 500 pixels, we'd use: <style> .larger-image { width: 500px; } </style>.

You could then apply the class to an image, as in:
<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat"> produces -->
<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat">

<h1> Borders </h1> <!--
CSS borders have properties like style, color and width. For example, if we wanted to create a red, 5 pixel border around an HTML element, we could use this class: <style> .thin-red-border { border-color: red; border-width: 5px; border-style: solid; } </style>.

NOTE: You can apply multiple classes to an element like so:
<p class = "class1 class2" (all within THE SAME quotes
-->
<h2> Border Radius </h1> <!--
Use to round corners. Do it with pixel value (border-radius: 10px;) OR percentage (border-radius: 50%;)
