<!-- INITIAL SETUP:
(a) Open a new file and save it as name_.html.
(b) Type "html" in the file and hit tab. This should bring up the default formatting for .html files.
(c) Open the saved file in Chrome to see how it looks. -->
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <!-- STEP ONE: put in the title. This is the (meta) page title — the part that shows up in the tab. -->
    <title>This Is a (META) PAGE Title</title>
    <!--STEP THREE (step two is below) — and remember to do the body text first — you enter the formatting/style for each header level. -->
    <style media="screen">
      h1 {
          color:yellow;
          font-weight: bold;
          font-family: fantasy;
          font-size: 100px;
        }
    </style>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>

    </script>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      $(document).ready(function(){
        console.log("hi there");
        // in here
      });
    </script>

  </head>

<!-- STEP TWO: write the body content for each level — headers, sub-headers and body text.
Below body, type h1 and press "tab" (see how that worked?) -->
  <body>
    <h1>If a katana sword could write, this is how it would write. Seppuku!</h1>
      <h2>This Is a Subtitle, a Level Two Header.</h2>
        <h3>Now I'm writing an even smaller header level. Isn't this neat?</h3>
          <p>
            <!--Matt: Where do I put the new lines (and do I have to enter them myself)? Why does Liz's program do this automatically?-->
            This is a paragraph. This paragraph has no purpose, really; I'm just trying to illustrate how you write a paragraph in html.
