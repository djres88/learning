#LESSON 8: What Is Express?
- By itself, Node is tiny. Not enough methods/functionality.
- You need something like Express on top to build real websites.
- Express is a *framework* â€” a way of structuring your code that gives you additional capabilities
  * That is, as long as you write code in the way the framework expects
- Express gives Node.js a more realistic structure for websites (not present when using node by itself)
- Uses two *templating engines* by default
  * Default: jade (tough to get used to)
  * Other: EJS (more like regular html)
- Provides a routing mechanism for URL (?)
- Access to an MVC (Model View Controller) Pattern. Flow thru:
  * Model -- the Data
  * View -- the Template (e.g. EJS)
  * Controller -- the JavaScript
