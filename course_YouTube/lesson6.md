#LESSON 6: BUILDING A HELLO NODE JS APPLICATION
1) Create a project folder
2) Create your first file (a .js file)
3) Import modules
- Node's equivalent of requiring jQuery
- Modules can be either built-in, or modules that you install
- Here we need the http module.
  * Look in Node's documentation here: https://nodejs.org/api/.
  * This shows you the series of methods and properties you can use
  * HTTP is a built-in module, so you don't need to install anything. Just need to require it.
4) Require the module in your .js file by assigning it to a variable:
```javascript
var http = require('http'); // adds the http module to the file
```
