#LESSON 10: BUILDING A HELLO EXPRESS APPLICATION
1) Create project folder
2) `npm init`
3) Need to add express as a dependency to your new project *even though you installed it as a global application*. Use `npm install express --save`
4) Create the main file — in this case, `app.js`

Now we're ready to start express hello world. See app.js file.

For a complete list of the methods and properties express gives you, check the API reference on http://expressjs.com/4x/api.html.
- most common are `.app` and `.get`
