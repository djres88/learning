#Notes from *The Linux Command Line*
## CHAPTER 1: An Introduction
###A. Why the Command Line?
* A good command line interfaces still provides an elegant way to communicate with the computer.
* "Graphical user interfaces make easy tasks easy; command line interfaces make difficult tasks possible."

###B. What is the Shell?
* The command line = the *shell* (synonyms)
  - Shell is a program that takes keyboard commands and passes them to the OS to carry out
  - Most Linux systems supply a shell program called `bash`, which stands for *bourne again shell*, a reference to the original Unix shell program `sh` for which bash is a replacement/enhancement
  - In graphical user interfaces (like your Mac), you access the shell using a "terminal emulator" -- for you, it's the *terminal* Application.

* Shell Orientation
  - The `Davids-Macbook-Pro:/ davidresnick$` beginning is called the *shell prompt*. It appears whenever the shell is ready to accept input.
    * NOTE: If the last character of the prompt is a hash mark (#) rather than a dollar sign, that means the terminal session has *superuser* privileges
  - **UP ARROW**: Recall last command (up to 500 back)
  - **LEFT/RIGHT ARROWS**: Navigate the command line text
